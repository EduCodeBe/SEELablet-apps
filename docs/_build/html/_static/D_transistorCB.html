    Make the connections as shown in the figure<br>
    Select a voltage at PV2, for setting emitter current<br>
    the Collector voltage and current are measured by the program and plotted in real time.<br>
    An ammeter is not shown , but current is calculated using the measured voltage drop across the known resistor. I = (PV1-CH1)/1k
