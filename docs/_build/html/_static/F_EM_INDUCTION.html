	<h3>Study Electromagnetic induction using a magnet and a coil</h3>
	<img src="images/magpend.png" style="width:100%;max-width:650px;"><br>
    Make the connections to the solenoid as shown in the figure.<br>
	oscillate a magnetic object near the coil, and observe the fluctuations.<br>
	Confirm that merely holding a magnet near the coil does not induce a voltage, and that the induced voltage is proportional to changing fields.
