  <body>Connect Collector to CH1 to Collector<br>
    Connect 1k resistor from PV1 to Collector<br>
    Connect Base to PV3 via 200k resistor<br>
    Select a voltage at PV3, for setting base current<br>
    and start increasing&nbsp; PV1 in steps. For each value<br>
    the Collector voltage and current are measured.<br>
    Current is obtained by (PV1-CH1)/1k
