    <img alt="" src="images/DiodeIV_bb_small.png"><br>
    Connect the Diode from CH3 to Ground.<br>
    Connect a 1k resistor from PV1 to CH3<br>
    <br>
    PV1 is varied in steps. For each step the current is <br>
    calculated from&nbsp; the difference between voltages <br>
    at PV1 and CH3.<br>
    It is plotted against voltage across the diode, at CH3.<br>
    Acquired plots can be selectively displayed or deleted.<br>
