	<h3>Dependence of drain current on D-S voltage, and Gate Voltage</h3>
	<img src="images/njfet.svg" width="100%" style="max-width:500px;"><br>
    Set the gate voltage for various values between 0, and -2 , and observe the effect on saturation current<br>
    <br>
    PV1 is varied in steps, and for each step the current is calculated from the difference between voltages at PV1 and CH1, and the known value of the resistor(1K)<br>
    Acquired plots can be selectively displayed or deleted.<br>
