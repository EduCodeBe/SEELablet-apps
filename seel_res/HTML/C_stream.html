	A pulse sensor made with a phototransistor, and a bright LED.<br>
	The phototransistor was connected to the SEN input, and its resistance was plotted against time.<br>
	A bright light source was aimed at it with a finger placed between the two, such that the light
	has to pass through the finger to get to the phototransistor.<br> The body's pulse causes the opacity
	of the finger to change, and this is reflected in the amount of light received by the sensor.
