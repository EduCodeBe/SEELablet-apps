	<h3>Acquiring Data</h3>
	As an example, set SQR1's frequency to 10KHz using the knob in the controls section.<br>
	Set its duty cycle to 0.03% using the adjacent duty cycle knob<br>
	You have now set the device to output a 10KHz square wave via SQR1 , and it spends only 0.03% of its time in the ON state(5V), and it's at 0V the rest of the time<br><br>
	In single channel mode, click on the START button. Once 2500 samples have been acquired(almost immediately for a 10KHz square wave) , click on PLOT DATA<br>

	Use the mouse wheel to scroll and zoom the plot<br>
	Drag the blue selection region the the area you wish to analyze<br>

	Once you click on RAW DATA, the time values of the various level changes in uS units will be shown in a spreadsheet<br>
	They are ready to export as data or images<br>

	The timing measurements section allows you to measure intervals between various logic changes between different/same inputs<br>
